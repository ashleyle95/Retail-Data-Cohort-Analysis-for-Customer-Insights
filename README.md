# Retail Data & Cohort Analysis for Customer Insights
## Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to analyze retail transaction data to gain insights into customer purchasing behavior, product sales performance, and revenue trends. By leveraging Python for data analysis, we aim to:
+ Identifying Sales Trends Over Time
+ Understanding Customer Behavior by Different Age Groups and Purchase Patterns
+ Uncovering Seasonal Trends in Sales to Optimize Inventory Planning
+ Analyzing Revenue Growth and Developing Strategies for Business Improvement
## Content
+ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: handling missing values (filling missing values with API key), removing duplicated values, checking data validity for numeric values and object values
+ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Customer Demographic, Product Overivew, Sales Trend
+ Cohort Analysis: Time-based Analysis, Behavior-based Analysis, Demographic-based Analysis
## Recommendations
1. Enhance Customer Retention Efforts
Loyalty Programs: Since retention has improved over time, introducing a loyalty or rewards program can further encourage repeat purchases.

Personalized Offers: Provide targeted promotions to March 2023 customers to keep them engaged.

Seasonal Promotions: Since declines happen after peak months, running exclusive post-peak discounts could help maintain engagement.

2. Improve First-Time Customer Acquisition

March Marketing Strategy: Since March is the strongest acquisition month, analyze what marketing campaigns were most effective and replicate them.

Increase Engagement in Low Months: Focus on attracting new customers in January and February, the weakest months.

3. Leverage Demographic Insights

+ 18-22 Age Group:
Appeal to younger consumers through social media marketing and influencer partnerships.
Create student discounts or limited-time offers in months with sharp declines.

+ 23-34 Age Group:
Focus on subscription models or bundled discounts to encourage repeat purchases.
Understand why april and May 2025 had a large drop and adjust campaigns accordingly.

4. Behavior-Based Cohort Analysis

Focus on customers who buy products across different months to offer seasonal products.

Segment these customers and track their retention to optimize marketing for high-value buyers.

Evaluate cross-selling opportunities to encourage repeat purchases.
## Limitations
1. Assumptions for Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is performed based on our assumptions to ensure consistency and reliability for further analysis.
Some data points may require standardization or filtering to align with the objectives of the cohort analysis.
Handling missing or inconsistent values is crucial to maintain the accuracy of insights.

2. Data Collection & Accuracy

To improve the reliability of cohort analysis, data should be collected over a longer period to capture trends and seasonality.
Expanding the dataset will enhance the statistical significance and generalizability of the findings.
Customer behavior and age group segmentation should be refined further by considering specific characteristics, such as purchase frequency, spending patterns, and engagement levels.

3. Cohort Analysis Considerations

A longer data collection period is essential to assess customer retention trends and evaluate the long-term value of different cohorts.
The analysis currently relies on a sample dataset, which may contain inconsistencies and noise. Future iterations should focus on cleaning and structuring the dataset more effectively.
Further segmentation of customer cohorts based on behavior and demographic insights will provide a more granular view of retention patterns.
